		<h1>New Releases on Spotify</h1>
		<p>
			This list is produced by parsing the contents of multiple webpages and utilizing the Spotify Web API to determine what music was released this year, and now available for streaming with Spotify.  A lot of work goes into Spotify and the producers of those websites and this is not meant to replace them, but rather exists as an enhanced way to access and enjoy the latest releases on Spotify.
